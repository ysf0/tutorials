# About Project
- My personal tutorials and notes.
- Contents are mixed. Only a high-level index exist (based on filename inside ["tutorials"](https://github.com/ysf0/tutorials/tree/master/tutorials) directory).
- Contents are written in Turkish and English.
- All tutorials should follow these standards: ["format of documents"](https://github.com/ysf0/tutorials/blob/master/format_of_documents.md).
